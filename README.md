# Repository search App

## Decription
This is a simple app which allows to search github repositories. Site was created with a **React.js v17.0.2**, **HTML5** and **SCSS**. I used GitHub REST AP: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search.

## Run
1. Download whole repository 
2. Go to the main project folder
3. Write  in terminal:
```
npm start
```
4. Open localhost:3000 (or any other default port) in your browser
5. Have fun :)
